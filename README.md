## Welcome to ggLoL Repository

Informative application about the video game League of Legends. With options to view profiles of players, spectate games, general information of the game, participation in tournaments, creator / search engine of teams and offline mode. Created using Windows Forms, the [MaterialSkin](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin) framework (in the visual section), the [Newtonsoft Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) framework, and the official [League of Legends API](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

### Functionality

Once the program has started, we have the options to register or login.
Once we have completed the login or registration, we will have several options, including:

- Basic information of the game (champions, skins, masters, profile icons, maps, spells or objects).
- Player's information and status (best champion, current starting status and possibility to watch -only if it is in game-, level, leagues in ranked, possibility of downloading CV about in-game experience (in PDF) and profile in application (in the previous registration).
- Search of equipment or search of players to play in game, together with private and public chat to communicate with other players.
- Game news (news, patch notes, free champions, offers).
- Overlay in game (to be able to see the information of your enemies before starting the game).

The application will have the option to download all data (images and videos) locally, so you do not have to constantly make requests. The icons will be downloaded the first time there will be an application. In addition, the user can exchange between a clear and dark subject.
